Yesterday, I watched an introductory explanationa about classes, attributes and methods. Today, I'll explore how to implement this knowledge on my Pygame project. 

I also learned what are sprites and how to use them in Pygame. I will definitely need some practice to stick the commands in my memory, but I have broaden my understanding of how Pygame commands are going to help me creat Pychave's collectibles.

Early today, I learned how to remotely access a private repository of my GitHub account (since learning_pygame is currently private), which included learning how to creat and use SSH keys. It seemed confusing at first, but it was fascinating to finally understand the logic behind it! 

Also, I learned that sometimes you need to use pip3 instead of pip to install things and explored markdown commands.
